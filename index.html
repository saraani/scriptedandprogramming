            <p class="m-3">A programming language is a computer language that is used by programmers (developers) to
                communicate with
                computers. It is a set of instructions written in any specific language ( C, C++, Java, Python) to
                perform a
                specific task.A programming language is mainly used to develop desktop applications, websites, and
                mobile
                applications.</p>

                Types of programming language
            </h5>
            <ol class="container">
                <li class="fs-4">Low-level programming language</li>
                <p>Low-level language is <strong> machine-dependent (0s and 1s)</strong> programming language. The
                    processor
                    runs low- level programs directly without the need of a compiler or interpreter, so the programs
                    written
                    in low-level language can be run very fast.

                    Low-level language is further divided into two parts -</p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="fs-5"> Machine Language</li>
                    <p>
                        Machine language is a type of low-level programming language. It is also called as
                        <strong>machine
                            code or
                            object code</strong> . Machine language is easier to read because it is normally displayed
                        in
                        binary or
                        hexadecimal form (base 16) form. It does not require a translator to convert the programs
                        because
                        computers directly understand the machine language. <br>The advantage of machine language is
                        that it
                        helps the programmer to execute the programs faster than the high-level programming language.
                    </p>
                    <li class="fs-5"> Assembly Language</li>
                    <p>
                        Assembly language (ASM) is also a type of low-level programming language that is designed for
                        specific processors. It represents the set of instructions in a <strong>symbolic and
                            human-understandable
                            form</strong> . It uses an assembler to convert the assembly language to machine
                        language.The
                        advantage of
                        assembly language is that it requires less memory and less execution time to execute a program
                    </p>
                </ul>
                <li class="fs-4">High-level programming language</li>

                <p>High-level programming language (HLL) is designed for <strong>developing user-friendly software
                        programs
                        and websites</strong> . This programming language requires a compiler or interpreter to
                    translate
                    the program into machine language (execute the program).

                    The main advantage of a high-level language is that it is <strong>easy to read, write, and
                        maintain.</strong>

                    High-level programming language includes <strong>Python, Java, JavaScript, PHP, C#, C++, Objective
                        C,
                        Cobol, Perl, Pascal, LISP, FORTRAN, and Swift programming language.</strong>

                    A high-level language is further divided into three parts -</p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="fs-5">Procedural Oriented programming language</li>
                    <p>Procedural Oriented Programming (POP) language is derived from structured programming and based
                        upon
                        the procedure call concept. It divides a program into small procedures called <strong>routines
                            or
                            functions</strong> .

                        Procedural Oriented programming language is used by a software programmer to create a program
                        that
                        can be accomplished by using a programming editor like IDE, Adobe Dreamweaver, or Microsoft
                        Visual
                        Studio.The advantage of POP language is that it helps programmers to easily track the program
                        flow
                        and code can be reused in different parts of the program.</p>


                    <li class="fs-5">Object-Oriented Programming language</li>
                    <p>
                        Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) language is based upon the objects. In this programming
                        language,
                        programs are divided into small parts called objects. It is used to implement real-world
                        entities
                        like inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, etc in the program to makes the program resusable,
                        efficient, and easy-to-use.

                        The main advantage of object-oriented programming is that OOP is faster and easier to execute,
                        maintain, modify, as well as debug.
                    </p>
                    <li class="fs-5">Natural language</li>
                    <p>
                        Natural language is a part of human languages such as English, Russian, German, and Japanese. It
                        is
                        used by machines to understand, manipulate, and interpret human's language. It is used by
                        developers
                        to perform tasks such as translation, automatic summarization, Named Entity Recognition (NER),
                        relationship extraction, and topic segmentation.

                        The main advantage of natural language is that it helps users to ask questions in any subject
                        and
                        directly respond within seconds.
                    </p>

                </ul>
                <li class="fs-4">Middle-level programming language</li>
                <p>Middle-level programming language <strong>lies between the low-level programming language and
                        high-level
                        programming language</strong> . It is also known as the intermediate programming language and
                    pseudo-language.

                    A middle-level programming language's advantages are that it supports the features of high-level
                    programming, it is a user-friendly language, and closely related to machine language and human
                    language. <br><br>

                a
                Scripting Language?</h5>
        </div>
        <div class="container ">
            <p class="m-3">A script or scripting language is a computer language that does not need the compilation
                step and is rather interpreted one by one at runtime. It is where the script is written and where
                instructions for a run-time environment are written. In contrast to programming languages that are
                compiled first before running, scripting languages do not compile the file and execute the file
                without being compiled.Scripts are often utilized to create dynamic web applications nowadays
                because they are linked to web development. Server-Side Scripting Languages and Client-Side
                Scripting Languages are the two types of scripting languages. Python, PHP, and Perl are examples of
                server-side scripting languages, while JavaScript is the greatest example of a client-side scripting
                language. These languages are often developed with the goal of communicating with other programming
                languages.</p>

                <ul class="py-2">
                    <li class="py-2"><strong>bash:</strong> It is a scripting language that's the default command
                        interpreter on
                        most GNU/Linux
                        systems and can be found on a variety of operating systems. As compared to other programming
                        languages, the use of bash is much easier to create scriptsIt stores documentation for
                        others to use, defines the tools to use and command line code, and provides useful reusable
                        scripts. Its name is short for 'Bourne-Again SHell'.</li>

                        language that
                        enables developers to create innovative software. It was established in 1993 by Yukihiro
                        Matsumoto of Japan and is excellent for web development. Ruby offers the same features that
                        are included in the languages such as Python, Perl, and Smalltalk.</li>
                    <li class="py-2"><strong>Node js:</strong> Writing network applications in JavaScript is
                        open-source and
                        cross-platform. It is not a programming language that reads and writes files on a
                        computer/server and handles networking, but it does employ JavaScript as the core
                        programming interface. For real-time web applications, corporate users of Node.js include
                        Yahoo, Netflix, PayPal, IBM, Microsoft, and LinkedIn.</li>

                        the most
                        widely used language among developers, in modern times. It is simple and interpreted. It's a
                        dynamically semantic language with enormous scripted lines of code. It has high-level data
                        structures built in, making it easy to use and suitable for Rapid Application Development.

                        is a popular, simple, and flexible general-purpose computer programming language. Dennis M
                        Ritchie
                        develops it in 1972 at AT&T. It is a combination of both low-level programming language as
                        well as a
                        high-level programming language. It is used to design applications like Text Editors,
                        Compilers,
                        Network devices, and many more.</p>

                        is one of the thousands of programming languages that we use to develop software. C++
                        programming language is developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1980. It is similar to the C
                        programming language but also includes some additional features such as exception handling,
                        object-oriented programming, type checking, etc.</p>
